### Description

Extract any or all icons from executables and dynamic link libraries. Includes most-recently-used file list, ini file usage, and a small HTML help page. Nothing groundbreaking here, I wanted a utility like this with these functions. Plus it's my first attempt at an HTML help file. I've been using it for a while. I made some tweaks to it and decided to release it.

[Updated to allow for scrolling through large number of icons.]
